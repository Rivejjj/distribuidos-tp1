[2Kgateway                        | Vector Quantization and Signal Compression (The Springer International Series in Engineering and Computer Science),"Herb Caen, a popular columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle, recently quoted a Voice of America press release as saying that it was reorganizing in order to ""eliminate duplication and redundancy. "" This quote both states a goal of data compression and illustrates its common need: the removal of duplication (or redundancy) can provide a more efficient representation of data and the quoted phrase is itself a candidate for such surgery. Not only can the number of words in the quote be reduced without losing informa tion, but the statement would actually be enhanced by such compression since it will no longer exemplify the wrong that the policy is supposed to correct. Here compression can streamline the phrase and minimize the em barassment while improving the English style. Compression in general is intended to provide efficient representations of data while preserving the essential information contained in the data. This book is devoted to the theory and practice of signal compression, i. e. , data compression applied to signals such as speech, audio, images, and video signals (excluding other data types such as financial data or general purpose computer data). The emphasis is on the conversion of analog waveforms into efficient digital representations and on the compression of digital information into the fewest possible bits. Both operations should yield the highest possible reconstruction fidelity subject to constraints on the bit rate and implementation complexity.","['Allen Gersho', 'Robert M.

From students to governments, from lawyers to universities, a host of institutions and actors believe that law schools should take account of a vast number of (often conflicting) considerations when teaching their students, designing curricula, carrying out research and so on. How do law schools deal with these pressures? What should their response be to the 'stakeholders' who urge them to follow agendas emanating from outside the law school itself? To what extent should some of these agendas play a greater role in the thinking of law schools?",['Fiona Cownie'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KAjcBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=KAjcBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA130&dq=The+Ultimate+Guide+to+Law+School+Admission:+Insider+Secrets+for+Getting+a+%22Big+Envelope%22+with+Your+Acceptance+to+Law+School!&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bloomsbury Publishing,2010-01-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KAjcBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Law'],

Covering landmark developments in America's modern culture and law, she charts the demise of what was dismissively called ""gentility"" in the face of First Amendment triumphs for journalists, sex educators, and novelists—from Margaret Sanger's advocacy of birth control to Judge Woolsey's celebrated defense of Ulysses.
